## Table of Contents

There has been a lot of information to document so I broke things out into their own separate documents so it's easier to organize relevant info; that said, here is a list of documentation:

* [About](./documentation/about.md)
* [Proxmox VM Setup](./documentation/proxmox-vm-setup.md)
