> An adapted approach towards managing my personal homelab.

## Why?

A few years ago, I sat back in my chair and wondered if there was a better way to manage my servers. At the time, I had a linode server and was paying something along the lines of several hundred dollars a year -- a cost I thought was acceptable because of my career in software architecture. Being the numbers person I am, I started to price things out to see how much it would cost to build a homelab; I very quickly became obsessed with this idea and spent a lot of time researching the best way to go about everything. I stumbled on [/r/homelab](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab) shortly after and found my stomping grounds; all sorts of homelab *amazingness* and the best part about it -- other people with similar ideas and a way to communicate with them. From there on out, I spent a lot of time trying to snipe bids on eBay for good homelab contenders. It wasn't long before I had a fully functioning homelab...

Since then, I've shifted my career from software archictecture to cloud architecture and primarily focus on Kubernetes clusters. I got hired at my dream job, [Heptio](https://heptio.com) (which has since been acquired by [VMWare](https://www.vmware.com/)) and have learned an abyss-full of ways to do things in the cloud.

So... This is *my* adapted approach towards managing my own personal homelab.

## Overview

Here is a diagram of what my homelab infrastructure looks like at the moment:
